## 📖 Description

White Noise Generator is a sleek, user-friendly web application designed to produce soothing white noise sounds directly in your browser.

The application offers an intuitive interface built with modern web technologies, allowing users to generate continuous white noise with just a click. Perfect for open offices, study sessions, meditation practices, or creating a peaceful sleeping environment.

## ✨ About This Project

This White Noise Generator was built as a practical solution for anyone seeking ambient sound to improve their productivity and well-being. The project demonstrates the power of web audio APIs combined with modern frontend frameworks to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing application.

The generator creates random audio patterns that blend seamlessly, producing the characteristic "static" sound of white noise. This sound contains all frequencies audible to the human ear at equal intensity, making it highly effective for sound masking and creating a consistent audio backdrop.
